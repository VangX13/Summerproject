# JavaLearningWebsite
This is a project we did over Summer 2022. 
We use HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript to create all the webpages and linked them together 

The purpose of the website is to teach people the basics of Java.   

The Sign up page does not work becasue we did not include a database to save the infromation to. 
The Login page is a gernal sign in page, so it can be login with the following: username - example@gmail.com and password - 123456
